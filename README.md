# ArduinoDigitalThermostat

My goal for this project is to create a WiFi connected thermostat and heater controller.

Proposed features:
- Read the current temperature on a digital LCD screen on the thermostat in my apartment
- Read the temperature on an iPhone app via the internet, anywhere in the world
- Set the heater to a specific temperature from the iPhone app

Current Hardware:
Arduino UNO with TMP 36 temperature sensor and LCD screen
