# Arduino Thermostat & Heater Controller

My goal for this project is to create a WiFi connected thermostat and heater controller.

Proposed features:
- Read the current temperature on a digital LCD screen on the thermostat in my apartment
- Read the temperature on an iPhone app via the internet, anywhere in the world
- Set the heater to a specific temperature from the iPhone app

Hardware:
- Arduino UNO
- Arduino WiFi Shield 101
- TMP 36 temperature sensor
- LCD screen
- Servo motor
